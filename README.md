Constellation Generator generates beautiful constellation like particles on screen with mouse movement. This is a project built using vanilla JS and vanilla CSS. The project has been built using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvz_axxWG4Y) lovely video as the base tutorial, although some significant portions of the code have been altered by me as a part of my own learning experience.
